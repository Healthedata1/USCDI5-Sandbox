	And our discrete stuff is more like a template. So we'd know the goal is using the template of "weight loss", but the actual goal would end up being "Weight < 200lb".  I haven't looked at how or if some or all of our templates map to standard codes.  Some probably would.  It isn't obvious that all would though.
