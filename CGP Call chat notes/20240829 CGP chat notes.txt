10:05:06 From Jason Vogt (MEDITECH) to Everyone:
	2 times he said last year... I'll keep track :)
10:06:48 From Jean Duteau to Everyone:
	Reacted to "2 times he said last..." with üòõ
10:19:00 From Brett Marquard to Everyone:
	ADI, if I have it I will exchange
10:19:12 From Brett Marquard to Everyone:
	ADI, if I have nothing in database, I will return nothing when queried
10:19:21 From Floyd Eisenberg to Everyone:
	Are we talking about an ADI, or just an observation that one exists and who verified but not the ADI itself?
10:19:43 From Brett Marquard to Everyone:
	My system doesn't support the assertion recording the patient has no ADI
10:23:35 From Floyd Eisenberg to Everyone:
	I know my healthcare provider allows me to check if I have an ADI or if I don‚Äôt, and if I have provided one.  So that provider captures the data.
10:31:21 From Brett Marquard to Everyone:
	45481-9 - Advance directive - none
10:31:27 From Brett Marquard to Everyone:
	Observation/value = 449891000124104 (No advance directive (finding))
10:32:00 From Floyd Eisenberg to Everyone:
	Quick comment - are we talking about 2 elements - ADI on file Y/N and Patient asserts having ADI Y/N - these are 2 different things
10:37:03 From Rob McClure [MD Partners] to Everyone:
	Oof ‚Ä¶
10:37:14 From Jason Vogt (MEDITECH) to Everyone:

10:38:15 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	and Laboratory Orders would use Service Request, but not FHIR Procedure Resource as some are doing.  FHIR Procedures would be used for Procedure orders as I read this.
10:40:27 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	Pulmonary Function test may be a non lab clinical test
10:44:56 From Gay Dolin to Everyone:
	Laboratory	Analysis of clinical specimens to obtain information about the health of a patient.	Tests	Values/Results
10:45:31 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	Reacted to "Laboratory
	Analysis ..." with üëç
10:45:43 From Brett Marquard to Everyone:
	Clinical Test	Clinical Test Result/Report
10:45:44 From Brett Marquard to Everyone:
	Clinical Test Order
10:45:58 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	the Term test refers to the "result" and the value/results refers to the result value.
10:46:33 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	Laboratory Order is the order including reflex orders, profile (physician 1 click orders that explode out to individual orders)
10:46:38 From Cooper Thompson (Epic) to Everyone:
	"Test" can't refer to the result in the context of USCDI, because there is a separate data element for the result.
10:47:09 From Cooper Thompson (Epic) to Everyone:
	There are three elements:  1) Clinical Test 2) Clinical Test Result and 3) Clinical Test Order
10:47:44 From Jason Vogt (MEDITECH) to Everyone:
	But it has historically. Test and Result go hand in hand in US Core.
10:48:56 From Jason Vogt (MEDITECH) to Everyone:
	We can move on
10:49:11 From Jason Vogt (MEDITECH) to Everyone:
	I have my answer
10:49:35 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	The structure/terms are slightly different for laboratory test orders, laboratory test results and laboratory result values.  Clinical Tests are structured a bit different
10:49:44 From Floyd Eisenberg to Everyone:
	Reacted to "I have my answer" with üëç
10:49:47 From Floyd Eisenberg to Everyone:
	Removed a üëç reaction from "I have my answer"
10:49:52 From Floyd Eisenberg to Everyone:
	Reacted to "I have my answer" with ü§û
10:49:56 From Floyd Eisenberg to Everyone:
	Removed a ü§û reaction from "I have my answer"
10:50:02 From Floyd Eisenberg to Everyone:
	Reacted to "I have my answer" with ü§û
10:51:03 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	CLIA also has specifications around lab orders (Test Request in CLIA language) and results and their values reported (Test Report in CLIA language).  CLIA doesn't apply to non lab tests
10:54:49 From Floyd Eisenberg to Everyone:
	Jason‚Äôs had raised
10:55:48 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	order only or OrdObs for codes that can be used for orders or observations
10:57:48 From Gay Dolin to Everyone:
	386053000 | Evaluation procedure (procedure) |
10:57:54 From Eric Haas to Everyone:
	Evaluation procedure (procedure) ~ clinical test
10:58:14 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	Many people have different definitions for procedurs
10:58:30 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	Lab orders should not use FHIR Procedure REsource
10:59:02 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	Having operational definitions helps clarify scope
10:59:06 From Andrea Pitkus to Everyone:
	and meaning
10:59:39 From Floyd Eisenberg to Everyone:
	Time check
11:00:45 From Jason Vogt (MEDITECH) to Everyone:
	If clinical test order and procedure order are the same category is makes it hard to test in Inferno
11:00:58 From Brett Marquard to Everyone:
	Reacted to "If clinical test ord..." with ü•≥
11:01:14 From Rita Torkzadeh to Everyone:
	Reacted to "If clinical test ord..." with ü•≥
