This extension is a modified from the FHIR Standard Patient Sex Parameter For Clinical Use Extension to show how the  `.code` element  which is defined as a "code that has the same meaning as the element in a particular terminology" can be used to fulfil   USCDI's Applicable Vocabulary Standard(s) = LOINC 99501-9 (Sex parameter for clinical use).  It also displays the element in the slice and uses the loinc in the URL so it can be seen in the instance.
