description: 'The US Core Observation ADI Documentation Profile inherits from the FHIR [Observation](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html) resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile and the [US Core Observation ADI Presence Profile] together meet the requirements of the [U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)](https://www.healthit.gov/isp/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi) *Advance Directive Observation* Data Element. It is used to communicate the types of advance directive documents for a patient, the document location, and other properties. Examples of advance healthcare directive documents include physician order for life sustaining treatment (POLST), do not resuscitate order (DNR), and medical power of attorney. To communicates whether any advance directive documents exist for a patient, see the [US Core Observation ADI Presence Profile]. This profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource to record, search, and fetch findings about advance directive documents. It specifies which core elements, extensions,  vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.'
